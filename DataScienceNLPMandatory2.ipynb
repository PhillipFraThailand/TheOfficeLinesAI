Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?\n",

      "People I respect, heroes of mine, would be Bob Hope... Abraham Lincoln, definitely. Bono. And probably God would be the fourth one. And I just think all those people really helped the world in so many ways that it's really beyond words. It's really incalculable.\n",

      "I don't need your permission.\n",

      "On his mother's grave.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.\n",
      "I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.\n",
      "I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.\n",
      "Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.\n",
      "Pam, information is power.\n",
      "No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.\n",
      "If I left, what would I do with all this useless information in my head? You know? Tonnage price of manila folders? Um, Pam's favorite flavor of yogurt, which is mixed berry.\n",
      "Jim said mixed berries? Well, yeah, he's on to me. Um... [Laughs]\n",

      "That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.\n",
      "It's OK here, but people sometimes take advantage because it's so relaxed. I'm a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy on the weekends. And you cannot screw around there. That's sort of one of the rules.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "That is my stapler.\n",
      "No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.\n",
      "OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?\n",
      "How do you know it was me?\n",
      "It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?\n",
      "Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.\n",
      "OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.\n",
      "[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.\n",
      "Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.\n",
      "OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.\n",
      "Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.\n",
      "Do you like going out at the end of the week for a drink?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.\n",

      "Do you mind if I go out for a drink with these guys?\n",
      "OK. I'm gonna be a few minutes. So it's only twenty past five. I still have to do my faxes.\n",
      "You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Um... What's in the bag?\n",
      "No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.\n",
      "Do I think I'll be invited to the wedding? [scratches head]\n",
      "So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second... and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?\n",
      "You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?\n",
      "Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...\n",
      "You got a fax.\n",
      "Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.\n",
      "What? Why?\n",
      "Why? Well, theft and stealing.\n",
      "Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?\n",
      "Post-it Notes.\n",
      "Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?\n",
      "50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.\n",
      "Are you serious?\n",
      "Yeah. I am.\n",
      "I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.\n",
      "But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.\n",
      "[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.\n",

      "What?\n",
      "Messages?\n",
      "People respond to the human touch and that's what I give them. I can look at a client and I can say, 'Hello, how are you? How's business been going?' And we can go back and forth for sometime and uh, then I'll say, How much, how many reams do you want?' And they'll order it and then I'll take care of all the sales. I'll make sure that they get that paper. And they appreciate that.\n",

But if they knew what was lurking on the other side of that fence that furry monster. [imitating monster] 'I'm gonna get you, downsizing.' No. They wouldn't... They'd freak. And I'm not going to play God. They look to me for support. And they look to me for guidance and leadership. And I think if I could lie to them and it serves them, then that's what I'm going to do.\n",
      "So this is our sales staff. They are the ones who are making calls and making us lots of money. [comes to a screeching halt and laughs] This is accounting. The numbers dudes. Do not let the job description fool you, they are all completely crazy. Especially that guy, he is a mental patient. [camera zooms in on Kevin] Not literally of course, that wouldn't work. The last place you'd want somebody like that is accounting. [hides behind office plant] 'Very interesting, but stupid.' Artie Johnson. It's a crazy place.\n",

It could be behind you or whatever. This is directly in a blind spot, so I'm trained to respond negatively to something right above my head. [new take] This now I have an eye on. You see, it's on my periphery and if I needed to block it, attack it, stop it somehow. [does a martial arts move with his hands] I could come right out. I mean, I know you're doing your job, but...

      "Sure.\n",
      "Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.\n",

No. Look... the guy, 'Mr. Brown,' he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart.

      "I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted... I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.\n",
      "Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.\n",

      "Yeah, more like a 1,000.\n",
      "I am a salesman, okay. And I don't think we should be doing this during prime sales hours. If you can prove to me that diversity is going to help my sales, I'll go elephant running with James Earl Jones. I really will, but not on spec.\n",
      "I just think that HERO? It's cute, but it's... It's empty, you know? It's easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind...\n",
      "Expectations....\n",
      "Thank you. Sharing...\n",
      "And tolerance.\n",

      "Well, it's not ideal but you have to give me some credit 'cause I made it into a word.\n",
      "I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We're all a family, right? We're all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally...\n",
      "No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.\n",
      "It would've been just as easy for him to spell insect. Of course, that wouldn't have made any sense either.\n",
      "Okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry this guy's a temp and I should've told you that.\n",
      "Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he's not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?\n",
      "Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? 'Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.\n",
      "Yeah, um, there's good things about Michael. He uh, uh... Yeah, definitely. Um...\n",

So it's fun, you know it's fun having a mind that works like that. That is just a few steps ahead of... comedically ahead of like what's going on.

Or, um, I know they'll be like oh boy that person deserved to be slammed down. There's going to be some sort of insult. And there is. You know, there's like, 'Oh you're... God your butt is fat.'

Last time I was down there, I noticed they'd put up a couple of hoops, and I play basketball every weekend. So I thought, 'This might be kinda fun.'  And so I started messing around and... I'm sinking a few, you know. Swish, swish, swish. Nothing but net. And their jaws just dropped to the floor. African-Americans!

      "I can handle that.\n",

      "Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.\n",
      "I do. I read Small Business man. I also uh, subscribe to USA Today and American Way Magazine, that's the in-flight magazine. Some great articles in that. They did this great profile last month of Doris Roberts and where she likes to eat when she's in Phoenix. Illuminating.\n",
      "This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I'm right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall]  used to be a window here. There's not anymore. So, that's where I will be.\n",
      "So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here.\n",

      "Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb\n",
      "No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day.  So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?\n",
      "Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.\n",
      "No.\n",

      "I have an idea.  Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?\n",
      "Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?\n",
      "Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?\n",
      "You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we're all millionaires. I'm probably closest. So here's Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.\n",
      "Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.\n",

      "True. Plus I can talk to her about the origins of my last name.\n",
      "It's all gold.\n",
      "Alright. Here's the thing okay, you just keep talking to her.  If you hit a stall you have a perfect fall back.\n",
      "What's that?\n",
      "You buy a purse.\n",

It's funny how the shelf life of these things, like how long they last, like, 'Too much information' probably came on the scene... I mean, I didn't hear it till, like, this month, so it's pretty recently. Um, but you know, they're generally good for, like, no more than five or six years.\n",

I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me, but they never wrote back. I guess they're all married.\n",
      "Angela, it's simple. Just tell me what the bathroom wall says.\n",
      "I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.\n",
      "Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?\n",
      "Well, what should I do, guys? Seriously, do you want me to just cancel the Dundies?\n",
      "Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.\n",

      "What do you think, Phyllis? You think I followed you in there? Like, 'Oh good. Phyllis is going to the bathroom, so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down.' I'm not even attracted to you.\n",
      "That is a good point.\n",
      "Okay, all right, I will do that. I will get to that definitely. Absolutely.\n",
      "Oh, I don't know. Maybe after I finish writing, producing, directing, and hosting your awards show. All right, just relax, keep your pants on. Unless, of course, you're in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you. Good.\n",
      "All right, let's wrap it up. Come on, we're late. The Dundies are starting very soon. Accounting, let's go, let's go. Okay, I gave you fair warning. [turns off their computers] Out. Who's next, customer service? Meredith, let's roll.\n",

      "[sighing] It was unanimous, Toby.\n",
      "Well, okay, I based it on what I felt was unanimous office sentiment, and this isn't even about what Ryan thinks. It's about you. It's about how you feel about the Dundies. Admit it.\n",

      "Nah, I'm okay.\n",

      "He doesn't even know that I do that.\n",
      "You should tell him.\n",

      "Dwight.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I'm sorry I said that, I didn't... just part of me meant it. Besides, he'd end up being a hero anyway.\n",

      "Um... Kevin, hands down. Yeah. He's really got that teddy bear thing going on, and afterwards, we could just watch bowling.\n",

      "Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.\n",
      "I gave it to you in the car.\n",
      "I saw you program it in.\n",
      "Okay. Alright.\n",
      "Uh, I better tell somebody. [to fireman] Excuse me, sir...\n",

      "Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.\n",
      "[coughing] Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing.\n",
      "Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.\n",
      "That's exactly what I said.\n",
      "Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?\n",
      "Were you absent?\n",
      "Toaster Oven 101?\n",
      "You failed?\n",
      "Hey! I know what'll impress everybody, I'll start a fire. Oh, man. Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.\n",
      "I have a song. Attention, everyone! That I want to sing. That I wrote especially for this occasion when I was up there among the flames. Ready? [sings to Billy Joel's 'We Didn't Start the Fire'] Ryan started the fire! It was always burning since the world's been turning!\n",

      "I forgot what a super, nice girl Katy is. And just... good for Jim! They are so cute together. And, um, what an adorable car.\n",
      "Okay, I think the game's over... People are like leaving. There was a bigger crowd last time. Do you just want to go to lunch?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Answer me this, though.\n",
      "Was it worth it? Was it worth it temp?\n",

      "Oh... look! Ryan is book smart. And I am street smart. And book smart.\n",
      "I'll give you the rest of the ten tomorrow.\n",
      "Seventy and clear, that's nice. Where's that?\n",
      "That's here.\n",
      "I'm Michael's number two. He's one, I'm two. He's Alpha, I'm Beta. He's A, I'm B. It's easy. Whatever Michael is, I'm one less.\n",
      "Rule three: Reach for the stars. And if you fail, see rule four. Rule four: Failure is not an option.\n",
      "Oh, my God. Ryan is gonna love these.\n",
      "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And at the end I will reveal, that they were all just one rule.\n",
      "That is so cool.\n",
      "Mmm-hmm.\n",
      "Plus you can go, 'Rule five, see rule six. Rule six, see rule five.'\n",
      "No, I'm not trying to trick him. I'm trying to be a good mentor. So...\n",
      "Kill or be killed.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Shoot to kill, or kill to shoot.\n",
      "No, come on, Dwight, I have to have 10 of these by lunch, I promised Ryan.\n",
      "You could ask for an extension.\n",
      "I'm not asking the temp for an extension unless I really need it.\n",
      "I know Michael's every move. It's not something you can just pick up. I could write a book about him. Literally. I started once, but Michael made me stop.\n",
      "Hey, how's it going, man?\n",
      "Oh, nothing much. What's up with you?\n",
      "Good. Good, I'm good, too. How's it cracking?\n",
      "You know what you would love? Guns N' Roses. When I was your age, I loved Guns N' Roses. Do you like Guns N' Roses? I'll make you a tape.\n",
      "I'll make you two tapes.\n",
      "Someday, temp. I've got a couple of shirts that don't fit so well anymore. I'll bring them by. Okay, see you later.\n",
      "Michael and I have a very special connection, like an umbilical cord. And the thing is with Ryan is that I don't want him to trip on it, or get it caught around his neck.\n",
      "I like fire drills. You know what's the greatest? Like, when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside.\n",
      "Oh, the best.\n",
      "Yeah, it was great because it was like you're supposed to be working, but nothing ever gets done.\n",
      "Yeah, we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything.\n",
      "[chuckling]\n",
      "Actually if I had fewer outside classes, I probably wouldn't be stuck here at a paper company.\n",
      "You're not stuck.\n",
      "Yes, yes, I ran out first. A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship. And this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire. So, I ran out onto the ship.\n",
      "Okay, DVDs. Five movies. What would you bring to the island? Toby, go ahead.\n",
      "Those are like my favorite movies. I didn't really think you could win Desert Island, but I think you just did.\n",
      "Toby and I used to sit together until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Kevin, do it.\n",
      "Groundhog Day.\n",
      "Okay, guys, guys, guys. That almost sounded like business, and we are trying to focus here today, okay?\n",
      "When I was Ryan's age, I worked at Arby's and then I worked selling cutlery for a while. Cutlery that could decimate a penny, I kid you not. There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny. So I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn't, and will never have.\n",
      "And then you go to school for three years.\n",
      "Wow. And just out of curiosity, how much is it?\n",
      "A semester?\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, it sounds like it.\n",
      "If I could change the life of one person, just one person. I... Actually, that's shooting kind of low. I already did that when I was born. I changed two people's lives. Mom and Dad. Um, if I could change the lives of 5,000 people... 10,000. No, five. I'd be satisfied with 5,000. I... 10,000 though, that'd be something. Wow, 10,000 people. Because, you know what? Even one is amazing.\n",
      "Happy Halloween, everyone! [notices Pam, in her cat costume] Oh... that's great!\n",
      "Hey... Happy Halloween. Jan called.\n",
      "Ohh... OK.\n",
      "I know why she's calling. It's the end of the month, and I was supposed to let somebody go by the end of the month.  And somehow I'm supposed to put on a costume and smile. [dials a number on his speaker phone] Okay.\n",
      "Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.\n",
      "Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.\n",
      "I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.\n",
      "Okay... Sherri?\n",
      "If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "I'll call her back. [talks softy, to himself] Wish I could fire Sherri.\n",
      "Okay! I'm sorry.\n",
      "No?\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "I mean you hear about layoffs in the news, but when you actually have to do it yourself, it is heavy stuff. It's... these are people's lives you're talking about.\n",
      "[entering] You wanted me?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "[notices Michael's costume] Papier-mache?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Yeeesh.\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\n",
      "Why did you put it off until Halloween?\n",
      "Because it's very scary stuff.\n",
      "I think it's gonna put a damper on the party a little.\n",
      "You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.\n",
      "So it's a man?\n",
      "No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?\n",
      "I just answer the phone.\n",
      "And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.\n",
      "You're costume is fantastic! [laughs]\n",
      "I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog. [bobs his head around, causing the costume head to jiggle around]\n",

I mean, if she left, I wouldn't blow my brains out. Of course, I would take that job in Maryland. Because it's double the pay, and soft shell crab just happens to be my favorite food.\n",

      "Okay, great. Fine. Well, then, if anyone is annoyed later at what goes down, you know who to blame. Stanley. Not the guy who was trying to be creative. [turns around to find Toby standing behind him]\n",

That's good eating, though. Venison's very gamey. It's hard to watch, though. It's hard to... It's hard to hit another living thing in the face with a shovel for about an hour. That... I haven't been hunting since then. I, I... 'Cause that's, you know, where's the joy in that? Where's the... There's no sport, really. Especially when you're the one with the shovel. And they're the one just lying there. Um... I would have rather hit it with my car or something and just... I was just smacking the hell out of that thing. That was a mess. And we just left him there. I didn't eat it. I didn't want to eat that. That guy. Why do you ask?\n",

      "This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?\n",
      "I'm busy.\n",
      "Well, [points at himself] busier. Making the time.\n",
      "Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.\n",
      "The shipping place closes in a half hour.\n",
      "I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's gangbang this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.\n",
      "I have been testing you the entire day. Did you know that?\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.\n",
      "Michael, I don't know...\n",
      "I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.\n",
      "I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.\n",
      "No, no, title change only.\n",
      "I'll have Pam send out a memo.\n",
      "No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.\n",
      "Just a formality.\n",
      "Absolutely but not really.\n",
      "Michael, I have so much to learn from you.\n",
      "Yes you do.\n",
      "Thank you, Sensei.\n",
      "And, ditto.\n",
      "I told Dwight that there is honor in losing. Which, as we all know, is completely ridiculous, but there is, however, honor in making a loser feel better which is what I just did for Dwight. Would I rather be feared or loved? Um, easy. Both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me. And I think I proved that today at the dojo.\n",
      "[Dwight's pager goes off] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Hold on. Sorry, just one second.\n",
      "Okay, I just...\n",
      "It's a sales call.\n",

      "What about Oscar? Could you beat Oscar?\n",
      "No problem.\n",
      "I don't know.  He looks pretty scrappy.\n",
      "Unless he has a shiv, in which case it wouldn't be a fair fight.\n",

      "No women or children. Unless provoked.\n",
      "Okay. Roy.\n",
      "Warehouse guy. Doesn't count.\n",
      "Okay. Michael. Could you beat up Michael?\n",
      "Yeah, I don't think that would happen. See, I used to run with a very tough crowd, street fighter types. Real, real bad people. I'm just lucky I got out. I was a bad ass mo-fo. Stanley knows what I'm talking about.\n",
      "I've never lost a fight. You know why? My motto. Never say die.\n",
      "You just said it. You just said it.\n",
      "No, that's not how I meant it.\n",
      "Die. You just... You said it.\n",
      "Shut up, Dwight.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Oh. Well, in my office, if you took off your shoes, it would be a sign of disrespect. Stinkyfeetville. Kind of a ying-yang. [exclaiming] Oh, stretchin'. I like to stay tight. Compact. [Dwight screaming]\n",
      "Do you have, do you have anything in, like, black?\n",
      "Alyssa? I guess she's technically the senpai. But nobody really respects her. The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls. Put me in that division. Let's see how she does.\n",
      "God, you look like such an idiot. [both yelling] [grunting]\n",
      "Stan the man.\n",
      "Did you hear about the fight? Well, it wasn't much of a fight, actually.\n",
      "I opened a big can of whoop-ass on him.\n",
      "I went medieval on his heinie.\n",
      "Hey, Stanley. I don't tell you how to do your job, do I? He...\n",
      "Grow a pair, Stanley. Right? There not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines. That's not how business works, okay? [sighs] Okay.\n",
      "For the record, let me just say, Michael Scott has no honor. If he lived in Japan, he would be an outcast. Well, that's not totally true, 'cause Asians worship chest hair. I had a friend, a hairy friend, who lived in Japan. He told me the women would line up to satisfy his every need. So, and he wasn't even that attractive.\n",

      "If you didn't badger me with so many questions, Pam, I could be done with it by now.\n",
      "No.  They're in the conference room.\n",
      "Wait, are those Michael's Levis?\n",
      "Michael and his jeans.  He gets in them, and I'm not exactly sure what happens.  But I can tell you, he loves the way he looks in those jeans.  I know that's why he started casual Fridays.\n",
      "[to Ryan] I'll take those. Thanks. [throws jeans under her desk]\n",
      "Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework.  Looks like USA Today.\n",
      "So this possible client they're talking about, actually a big deal.  It's Lackawanna County.  Our whole county.  And if we get this, they may not have to downsize our branch.  And I could work here for years.  And years.  [groan] Years.\n",
      "I changed it.  To Chili's.\n",
      "Radisson just gives out this vibe, 'Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson'.  It's kind of snooty.  So.\n",
      "Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.\n",
      "It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.\n",

      "No...\n",
      "What is going on?\n",
      "We are doing worst first dates.\n",
      "Oh my God, I win!  Ok, it was a minor league hockey game. He brought his brother, and when I went to the bathroom, the game ended and they forgot about me.\n",
      "No, they had to come back for me.\n",
      "Wait, when was this?\n",
      "Umm... it was not that long ago.\n",
      "I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy, but I never knew why.  Interesting.\n",
      "Ok, let's do this thing.  [to Pam] Wish us luck.\n",
      "Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.\n",
      "[under his breath] Kiss ass.  Ok, probably going to go late tonight.  Burning the midnight tequila.  So, I think you could all just take off now.\n",
      "Well...\n",
      "No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  [Jan stares at Michael] That's not true.  I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here.  Not more.  The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not. [another Jan stare]  Hey, everybody, listen up.  This is what we're gonna do.  You sit tight, until I return.  Sound good?  Doesn't matter, it's an order.  Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok?  Alright, ciao.  [to Oscar] Adios!\n",
      "Uh, I'll drive.\n",

      "It's performance review day, company-wide.  Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were, and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press 190 pounds.  So, I don't really know what to expect.\n",
      "Pam, you're trustworthy-\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "And a woman-\n",
      "Oh, no.\n",
      "And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss. [Jan on recording] 'Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon.'  First impressions?\n",
      "Uh, just off the top... I think she'll be here this afternoon.\n",
      "My boss is coming in today, the lovely Jan Levinson-Gould will, well, no Gould. The Gould has been [makes slashing neck hand motion] swack, divorced.  Um, the awkward part is that this will be the first time that we'll be seeing each other since, well, uh, it was really nothing.  We just sort of got caught up in the moment.  The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the understanding, with rugged good-looks, office manager.  Just, uh, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.  It, we both, I didn't want it, we both didn't want it to continue.  Was not professional.  Um, when people say something's mutual, it never is.  But this was mutual.\n",
      "[playing Jan's message] 'I guess I missed you.' I guess I missed you.  So, she misses me?\n",
      "She missed you.\n",
      "But then she goes on to say 'that will be our only topic of discussion'.  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.\n",
      "I have one idea of what it means.\n",
      "Ok. Yeah, what, what?\n",
      "Well I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.\n",
      "Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-\n",
      "Because she's conflicted.  She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings... for you.\n",
      "Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?\n",
      "Um, just cause, that, you work together, and it might be awkward.\n",
      "Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again. [plays Jan's message] 'Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you'.\n",
      "Oh, hey, listen, Jim.  Here's a little tip for your performance review.\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.\n",
      "We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.\n",
      "Oh, yes, we do.\n",
      "No, we don't.\n",
      "Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.\n",
      "Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.\n",
      "Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?\n",
      "I win.\n",
      "Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.\n",
      "Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?\n",
      "Uh, duh.\n",
      "Duh.\n",
      "Today is Thursday.  But Dwight thinks that it's Friday.  And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.\n",
      "No kidding.\n",
      "Michael and Jan definitely made out.\n",
      "Ohh...\n",
      "Maybe more.\n",
      "Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.\n",
      "Oh, yea!\n",
      "Good work, Stanley. Great performance review.  Stanley in the house, everybody.  Woo!  Angela, your turn.\n",
      "Michael?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Jan's on the phone for you.\n",
      "Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.\n",
      "Interesting.  Jan is calling me.  Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all. [puts Jan on speakerphone] Yeah?\n",
      "Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?\n",
      "Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.\n",
      "Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Been thinking about you.\n",
      "Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "They are not.  Yes, they are. [Jan hangs up]  That's my girlfriend.\n",
      "Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis. I know I do.  I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.  Um, is there any chance you wrote any of my ideas down?  In a folder?  A 'Michael-idea' folder?\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.\n",
      "What suggestion box?\n",
      "The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?\n",
      "Oh, yeah. Uh, I think I remember that from back from when I first started.\n",
      "Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.\n",
      "What did I say?\n",
      "Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?\n",
      "[on phone] Hey, Dan, this is Jim, and it is about 11:15, and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the fifteenth, and that is a...\n",
      "Saturday.\n",
      "[pumps fist] ...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Hi, Jan.  How are you?\n",
      "Good to see you.\n",
      "Ok. [tries to kiss Jan's hand] Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here.\n",
      "Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous. [mouths to Pam] No calls.\n",
      "Alright [takes Jan's coat].\n",
      "It's nice to see you.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Oh, well.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Yep.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "I'm a little confused.  'Cause first it's all like kissy-kissy.  And then it's like all regret.  Because 'Oh, I regret that.'  But, 'Wait, I'm still gonna call you.'  But, but, 'We're just gonna talk business.  And I may come down and fire you if you don't do your job.'  But what were talking about when we first kissed?  Business.\n",
      "No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.  [cold Jan stare]  We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?\n",
      "This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.\n",
      "Are you wearing a new perfume today?\n",
      "Well, you're wearing it at the office. And [smells Jan] it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.\n",
      "Hey, Jim.\n",
      "Hey, how's it goin'?\n",
      "Oh my God, did you see 'The Apprentice' last night?\n",
      "Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?\n",
      "Can you believe who Trump fired?\n",
      "No, that was unbelievable.\n",
      "Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?\n",
      "You didn't see it?\n",
      "No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?\n",
      "I don't understand- [phone rings] Hold on.  Sorry. [answers]  Yes, Pam.\n",
      "Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.\n",
      "I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.\n",
      "You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.\n",
      "I did not, not, not use those words.\n",
      "No, it's in like ten minutes.\n",
      "Everyone's waiting in the conference room.\n",
      "Why are we here?  Because I value your opinions.  Now, I know a lot of don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.  I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.  Um, so, let's, uh, just read some of these suckers.  Alright.  Number one: 'What should we do to prepare for Y2K?'\n",
      "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?\n",
      "Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box. [to Jan] That happens occasionally.\n",
      "It happens occasionally.\n",
      "And, um, one down.  Next suggestion: 'we need better outreach for employees fighting depression'.  Ok, alright, enough with the jokes.  Nobody in here is suffering from depression.\n",
      "Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?\n",
      "Tom?\n",
      "Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.\n",
      "Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.\n",
      "Next suggestion.\n",
      "Arrr, dooby dooby do. 'You need to do something about your B.O.'\n",
      "You need to do something about your B.O.\n",
      "Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.\n",
      "Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.\n",
      "Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  'You need to do something about your coffee breath'-\n",
      "You need-\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "To do something about-\n",
      "Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.\n",
      "Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-\n",
      "I'll work on that-\n",
      "Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.\n",
      "Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?\n",
      "Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.\n",
      "Next suggestion.\n",
      "Don't sl-', ok, that's blank [Dwight picks up note] Don't, just put it-\n",
      "Don't sleep with your boss'? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?\n",
      "I don't understand why you're so upset.\n",
      "Let me ask you-\n",
      "Ok, let me ask you this.\n",
      "Let me ask you something.\n",
      "Where did you get your outfit?\n",
      "[loud metal music playing in a stairwell; Dwight pacing] You are giving me this raise!  I deserve this raise! [plays air guitar] Yes! [kicks] Yes! Yes! Hiya!  The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation! Keeya eyah!  Yes!  Why are you gonna give me this raise?  Why?  Because... I'm awesome! I am awesome!\n",
      "I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.\n",
      "Look-\n",
      "Michael?\n",
      "Oh my God...\n",
      "I'm sorry, am I interrupting?  Oh God; were you guys making out?\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "What do you want Dwight?\n",
      "I am ready for my performance review.\n",
      "Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.\n",
      "You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.\n",
      "Uh, wait, I would like to discuss my raise?\n",
      "Why on earth would we give you a raise?\n",
      "That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one word: dedication. [points to graphs] I have never been late.  Also, I have never missed a day due to illness. [Michael sighs] Even when I had walking pneumonia.  I even come in on holidays.\n",
      "You do?  How do you get in?\n",
      "I have a copy of your key.\n",
      "That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.\n",
      "I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.\n",
      "Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?\n",
      "For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.\n",
      "That was deer!? Gross, oh!\n",
      "You liked it!\n",
      "Oh, did not!\n",
      "Jan, have you ever had deer?\n",
      "It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.\n",
      "What do you say, Jan?\n",
      "Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.\n",
      "And in conclusion, I think that Lex Luthor said it best when he said 'Dad, you have no idea what I'm capable of'.\n",
      "That's from Superman?\n",
      "Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.\n",
      "Do you think Michael and Jan actually...\n",
      "I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.\n",
      "How do you come back from that?\n",
      "Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.\n",
      "No, I mean doing that with Michael. How do you come back from that?\n",
      "Oh-\n",
      "As a human being.\n",
      "Yeah, no, I don't think you can.\n",
      "Wait.\n",
      "Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?\n",
      "Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?\n",
      "Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?\n",
      "I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?\n",
      "Am I too short?\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "I appreciate that, thank you.\n",
      "No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-\n",
      "So my looks have nothing to do with it?\n",
      "Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now.  And it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.  And that is all I needed; I'm good.  I can go home now.\n",
      "Hey, it's 12:20; where the hell's Dwight?\n",
      "Ummm... no idea.\n",
      "Never missed a day, my ass.\n",

      "Yes.\n",
      "No, you don't.\n",
      "Then why the question?\n",
      "This is a visual aid for my performance review. Budget is tight, and if anyone is getting a raise, it is gonna be a fight to the death. And I intend on winning that fight. 'Dwight: determined, worker, intense, good worker, hard worker, terrific. Dwight.'\n",

      "You have to tell me.\n",
      "I don't have to tell you anything.\n",
      "Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.\n",
      "Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this. [flexes his arms] Brrr!  That's strong!\n",
      "Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-\n",
      "I'm not going get a brain-\n",
      "Or get hit by a car-\n",
      "Stop it.\n",
      "Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.\n",

      "There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees.  His salary, that would depress them.  His bed, it---  And I am not going to tell them that I'll be reading their e-mails.\n",
      "So how do you search?\n",
      "Try 'profits'.  No! Try 'Michael Scott'.  'Michael' 'boss' and 'funny'. [Sadiq (IT guy) types; result pops up] Oh my God, wow!  [chuckles]  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley,  Terribly nice guy.  [reads e-mail]  'Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late.'  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.\n",

      "You know what the problem is?\n",
      "The problem is that when people hear the term 'big brother', they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.\n",

      "Nice.\n",
      "One is tall and brunette, and the other one is short, and blonde, and perky, and kinda judgmental.  Who do you think he should choose?\n",
      "Does he have access to their medical records?\n",
      "Ummmm...\n",
      "I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records.  As a volunteer sheriff, I can look up anyone's psychiatric records or surgical histories.  Yeast infections.  There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county.  Probably because we are down river from that old bread factory.\n",

      "Listen, are you bringing anyone to Jim's party tonight?\n",
      "No. I mean, I don't know, I don't think so.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "There's always a distance between a boss and the employees.  It is just nature's rule.  It's intimidation mostly, it's the awareness that they are not me.  I do think that I am very approachable, as one of the guys.  But maybe I need to be even approachabler.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.\n",
      "Uh hum.\n",
      "Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.\n",
      "The professors would go to the parties?\n",
      "Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.\n",
      "It's true. I'm having a party.  I've got three cases of imported beer, a karaoke machine, and I didn't invite Michael.  So three ingredients for a great party.  And it's nothing personal, I just think that if he were there, people wouldn't be able to relax, and you know, have fun, and my roommate wants to meet everybody.  Because I'm pretty sure he thinks that I'm making Dwight up.  [sighs]  He is very real.\n",
      "[to cameraman] What? [looks at Dwight eating a Baby Ruth] Ohhhh... Yes!  Thank you!\n",
      "Question: on the Internet there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight-\n",
      "Oh, uh, no. Could-\n",
      "I was wondering-\n",
      "Could, keep that down.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Because not everybody knows about the party.\n",
      "Like who?  Who doesn't know?\n",
      "Umm, Michael.\n",
      "Why just Michael?\n",
      "Because it's a surprise.\n",
      "Is it?\n",
      "Uh hmm.\n",
      "Oh, that's perfect!\n",
      "So, don't tell.\n",
      "I won't.\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "So, Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael.\n",
      "Really? That's great.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere.\n",
      "[laughs] Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...\n",
      "Oh, no, he can't make it.\n",

      "Hey.\n",

      "Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.\n",

      "You do?\n",
      "I do, yeah. Big plans.\n",
      "Because you said 'do you wanna hang out'-\n",
      "Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.\n",

      "Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday. [to the camera]  He has no idea!\n",
      "Quick announcement everybody, if I could have everybody's attention.  We do have wine in the kitchen, and, uh, there is beer available on the porch and despite what you might think, it's not all for Meredith and Kelly, so please enjoy.\n",
      "Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock?\n",
      "You don't work with us.\n",
      "That's because Mark's my roommate.\n",

      "Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.\n",
      "Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.\n",

      "A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.\n",
      "Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.\n",
      "So this year, for the first time ever, I got Pam in Secret Santa. And I got her this teapot, which I know she really wants, so she can make tea at her desk. But I'm also going to stuff it with some inside jokes. Like, this is my high school yearbook photo. She saw it at the party, and it really makes her laugh. Not sure why. What else .. ooh. This is a hot sauce packet. She put this on a hot dog a couple years ago because she thought it was ketchup. And it was really funny, so I kept the other two. [holds up a miniature pencil] This would take a little too long to explain, so I won't. And this is the card. Because Christmas is the time to tell people how you feel.\n",
      "[comes into the conference room in a Santa hat and beard]  Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho, [points to Ryan] pimp. I'm kidding. What do we got, what do we got? How many plates are we getting?\n",
      "Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.\n",
      "It was a tough year. I had to fire somebody this year. This party has to really rock. Check it out. Christmas bonus. 3,000 G's. I got this for helping save the company money. So I guess some good came out of firing Devon after all. Maybe I should call him and tell him that.\n",
      "I want people to cut loose. I want people making out in closets. I want people hanging from the ceilings, lamp shades on the heads. I want it to be a Playboy Mansion party. And also, I want you to spread the word that I will have my digital camera. And I'll be taking pictures all along the way. And the best and craziest thing that happens will be on the cover of the newsletter. Incentive.\n",
      "You do realize that we can't serve liquor at the party.\n",
      "Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.\n",
      "You guys should use a hand truck.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "No! No way! It... no.\n",
      "You wanna be Santa?\n",
      "Have you ever seen Santa?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.\n",
      "Michael, I would like to be the elf.\n",
      "That makes sense because he has elfish features.\n",
      "[now wearing an elf hat and ears] Okay, everybody listen up! It is time to get your presents, wrap them, and place them under the tree like so. If you do not get your present wrapped and under the tree within the next five minutes you will be disqualified from Secret Santa. All right? No exceptions except Michael.\n",
      "You get something good this year?\n",
      "I think I did a pretty good job.\n",
      "Yeah? Who did you have?\n",
      "Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret.\n",
      "I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.\n",
      "Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?\n",
      "Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.\n",
      "That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can ..\n",
      "It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.\n",
      "Gather round. Secret Santa, let's go. Let's go. Come on. Stanley, no, I'm going to handle the cord. Okay, safety reasons.\n",
      "I want to do it.\n",
      "All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?\n",
      "Not great.\n",
      "I think the tree looks nice.\n",
      "Hey, I could get some flares from my car.\n",
      "No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.\n",
      "Presents are the best way to show someone how much you care. It's like this tangible thing that you can point to and say, 'Hey, man, I love you this many dollars worth.'\n",
      "First present, Oscar.\n",
      "Okay. Okay. That's enough. Let's keep it moving on. Jim.\n",
      "Oh, cool. [opens his plastic bag]\n",
      "Great. Where did you get it?\n",
      "He obviously forgot to get me something, and then he went in his closet and dug out this little number [holds up way-too-short sleeves] and then threw it in a bag.\n",
      "Pam.\n",
      "[opens up her present] Oh, my god! Thank you very much, Santa, whoever you are. It's awesome.\n",
      "There's a little more to it.\n",
      "All right, next. Ryan. [tosses present]\n",
      "No, don't!\n",
      "Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.\n",
      "You don't know that.\n",
      "I did?\n",
      "What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?\n",
      "Michael.\n",
      "Oh hey, for me. What is in here? [opens a handmade oven mitt] Oh, come on.\n",
      "An oven mitt? Okay. [walks out]\n",
      "So Phyllis is basically saying, 'Hey Michael, I know you did a lot to help the office this year but I only care about you a homemade oven mitt's worth.' I gave Ryan an iPod.\n",
      "We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.\n",
      "I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.\n",
      "What is Yankee Swap?\n",
      "One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.\n",
      "I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.\n",
      "Yeah, we call it White Elephant.\n",
      "Well, I call it fun!\n",
      "Because it's better. Because it's more special.\n",
      "Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.\n",
      "Okay, Meredith is up first. Here's the deal. You can either pick a new gift or you can steal somebody else's gift that they've already gotten, like the oven mitt.\n",
      "Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.\n",
      "Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.\n",
      "I'll take the iPod.\n",
      "Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.\n",
      "I think this is going great.\n",
      "Angela, you're up.\n",
      "Everyone wants the iPod. It's a huge hit. It is almost a Christmas miracle.\n",
      "Oh, well, Oscar, you little gourmand, you have the next turn.\n",
      "Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.\n",
      "It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.\n",
      "[holding oven mitt] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.\n",
      "Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.\n",
      "Reverse psychology is an awesome tool. I don't know if you guys know about it, but basically you make someone think the opposite of what you believe and that tricks them into doing something stupid. Works like a charm.\n",
      "[opens present] 'In addition to these paintball pellets, your gift includes two paintball lessons with Dwight Schrute.'\n",
      "You and me, Michael. Yes!\n",
      "Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?\n",
      "I never said it was better than an iPod.\n",
      "Michael keeps bragging about his iPod, but you know what? Two paintball lessons with someone as experienced as I am is worth easily, like, 2 grand.\n",
      "[shooting paintball gun at target] Take that, Saddam!\n",
      "Last gift. Kevin.\n",
      "Pam, steal something or pick the final gift.\n",
      "I want the iPod.\n",
      "Sure you don't want the teapot?\n",
      "Well, I mean, it's an iPod. But ..\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Sorry, I ..\n",
      "No. No. Definitely. It's ..\n",
      "Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.\n",
      "Got to be kidding me.\n",
      "Yankee Swap is like Machiavelli meets ... Christmas.\n",
      "[after Phyllis leaves suddenly] What is she so upset about?\n",
      "Maybe because you hated her present so much.\n",
      "Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.\n",
      "Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.\n",
      "Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!\n",
      "How much?\n",
      "It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.\n",
      "Unbelievable. I do the nicest thing that anyone has ever done for these people and they freak out. Well, happy birthday, Jesus. Sorry your party's so lame.\n",
      "All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?\n",
      "Cool, cool. Box it up.\n",
      "I bought this teapot for Pam, and I know she really wants it. So, can I trade you for it?\n",
      "No trades.\n",
      "Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.\n",
      "A real man makes his own luck.' Billy Zane.\n",
      "Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?\n",
      "No. I want it. I'm going to use it.\n",
      "You don't even drink tea.\n",
      "True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems ..\n",
      ".. and pouring it directly into your nose, like so. [demonstrates]\n",
      "To think that my gift for Pam will be used for that, it's a little too much to handle.\n",
      "I know. It's totally going to change the way I work out.\n",
      "So what are you going to get me instead?\n",
      "Uh-oh. Looks like Santa was a little naughty.\n",
      "This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.\n",
      "Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?\n",
      "Go, here we go!\n",
      "Anybody making out in here? [checks hallway] Not yet, give it time. Oh, hey, Ebenezer, boink. [takes picture of Jim] Okay, how's it going in here? [takes picture of Meredith and Kevin]\n",
      "No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.\n",
      "Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.\n",
      "Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.\n",
      "You know, you don't have to answer calls during a party. Just thought you should know.\n",
      "[laughs] No, I was just checking out my present. [holds up teapot]\n",
      "But ..\n",
      "I traded with Dwight. Just, I figured, you know, you went to a lot of trouble and it means a lot. And also, Roy got me an iPod or was going to get me an iPod, so ..\n",
      "Well, either way. This is an amazing gift because it comes with bonus gifts. Look inside.\n",
      "[opens teapot] Oh my god! The yearbook picture!\n",
      "Yeah, I think I made the right choice.\n",
      "Oh, my God! It's incredible. [Jim reaches and steals his card back before she can notice it] Is this the Boggle timer?\n",
      "I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.\n",
      "This is so awesome.\n",
      "Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!\n",
      "Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.\n",
      "Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.\n",
      "Darryl. There you go. [hands him the Santa hat] You earned it.\n",
      "No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.\n",
      "Hey, Merry Christmas.\n",
      "[coming out of his office] Lampshade on head! It's happening!\n",
      "Oh, hello there. [Kelly leans up and kisses him] But what are you doing?\n",
      "You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah, that sounds good.\n",
      "Christmas is awesome. First of all, you get to spend time with people you love. Secondly, you can get drunk and no one can say anything. Third, you give presents. What's better than giving presents? And fourth, getting presents. So, four things. Not bad for one day. It's really the greatest day of all time.\n",
      "Hey, Meredith. Heading over to Poor Richard's?\n",
      "Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride? [Meredith drops her top. Michael takes a picture] All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?\n",
      "Okay!\n",
      "Remember on that animated special when they taught the uh, the monster to put the star on top? That's Dwight. Dwight's the monster that we taught to put the star on top of the tree. You take his teeth out, and he could put the star on top of the tree.\n",
      "Do you want me to help you with that?\n",
      "Phyllis and Angela and Meredith are helpers. I guess Angela's kind of... Angela's little. Phyllis and Meredith are not little. Pam is sort of a medium helper.\n",
      "Okay. Christmas lights? Good. Tinsel? Good. Star? Good.\n",
      "Dwight is... Dwight looks like Spock to me. He always wears the ears, and I always give him grief about looking like Spock, and he hates it because he has a different pair of ears that he wears to be Spock, for some reason.\n",
      "Question, Pam. Is Roy coming to the party?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Okay, well, you didn't tell me that. Now, he will not be allowed in unless we register him on this list.\n",
      "Are you kidding?\n",
      "Do I look like I'm kidding? [Pam shakes her head 'no'] Phyllis, stag, I assume.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Everyone, please remain calm until we receive further instructions.\n",
      "Just let us open up the presents, Dwight.\n",
      "Absolutely... not.\n",
      "What separates humans from jungle beasts? The fact that we have rules. When humans give each other gifts, they do it properly and orderly. When bears give each other gifts they just rip open a fox carcass and present it to their mate. I prefer the human way.\n",
      "Well, thank God you didn't steal my oven mitt. And Oscar, you little gourmand, your turn.\n",
      "Oscar, paint ball pellets.\n",
      "It was supposed to be for Meredith, 'cause she said she likes my drawings.\n",
      "Yeah. Like anybody would want an oven mitt. [Phyllis gets up and leaves the party]\n",
      "I do enjoy a drink now and again, but tonight, no. I am also an officer of the law and I'm unofficially on the clock. I need to stay sober and alert. Also, on a personal note, I'm not at my best when I drink.\n",
      "See, that's what Christmas is all about to me, is when you see someone open a gift and you think, 'Man, I wish I got that.' I mean, that's just such a great feeling, to watch other people envying a gift that you gave to somebody else. I don't know, it's just... I don't know, just makes you kind of feel good.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hello. Jim?\n",
      "What's up, buddy?\n",
      "This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?\n",
      "Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.\n",
      "Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.\n",
      "Who, Steve?\n",
      "Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.\n",
      "Sorry. What do I want? What do I want... Oh, it's a pencil cup.\n",
      "No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.\n",
      "Um, I don't think so, I just bought it.\n",
      "Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.\n",
      "I love these.\n",
      "Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?\n",
      "Oh, there it is. J1.\n",
      "But I don't have any...\n",
      "Here, you know what? You can have some nickels.\n",
      "[putting quarters in] Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...\n",
      "Hello, everyone.\n",
      "Good morning, Michael.\n",
      "Ah! Ha ha ha!\n",
      "Last week, Michael sent out this mysterious memo.\n",
      "It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask.'\n",
      "A ski mask and a swimsuit.\n",
      "So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.\n",
      "And brush our teeth.\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Stanley! Bo banley.\n",
      "Banana fana fo fanley.\n",
      "Be my mo manley.\n",
      "Stanley.\n",
      "Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?\n",
      "Maybe, I don't know.\n",
      "Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.\n",
      "It's cheaper.\n",
      "This is not just another party. This is a leadership training exercise. Right? I'm going to combine elements of fun and motivation and education into a single mind-blowing experience.\n",
      "It is now time to unveil the destination of this year's retreat. We are going on a harbor cruise of Lake Wallenpaupack. It's a booze cruise!\n",
      "No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.\n",
      "Well, this...\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "To throw you off the scent.\n",
      "Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.\n",
      "Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, 'Who is this smart little cookie?' Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.\n",
      "I am a great motivational speaker. I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year, and... it wasn't the actual course. You have to pay for the actual course. But it talked about the actual course. And I've incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course.\n",
      "Leader... ship. The word 'ship' is hidden inside the word 'leadership,' as its derivation. So if this office is, in fact, a ship, as its leader, I am the captain. But we're all in the same boat. Teamwork!\n",
      "Now, on this ship that is the office, what is a sales department? Anyone?\n",
      "Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.\n",
      "Yeesh, how old is this ship?\n",
      "How about the anchor?\n",
      "All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!\n",
      "I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?\n",
      "Titanic?\n",
      "I think you're thinking of The Hunt for Red October.\n",
      "No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!\n",

      "The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.\n",

      "Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.\n",
      "You know what? I would save the receptionist. I just wanted to clear that up.\n",
      "I don't want to take credit for this, but Roy and I were just having a conversation about making commitments and making choices. Right? Did I motivate you?\n",
      "Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!\n",
      "Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!\n",

      "Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...\n",
      "It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.\n",
      "I'm in the brig. See? The boat's not as corporate-friendly as advertised. What was the deal with the guy jumping overboard? What was... if he had just waited and heard what I had to say, he would be motivated right now and not all wet.\n",

      "What happened to you?\n",
      "Captain Jack has a problem with authority.\n",
      "Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?\n",
      "He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.\n",
      "What a night.\n",

      "She was always engaged.\n",
      "Roy said the first one didn't count.\n",

      "Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...\n",
      "Yeah, I know.\n",
      "Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.\n",
      "Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.\n",

      "Leadership off-site. Uh, booze cruise is just a rhyme...\n",
      "Yeah, I don't even know why I said booze cruise. I don't even think there's booze on the boat.\n",
      "Of course.\n",
      "Of course, of course. Yes. Yes. Look, I have a whole program planned. Jan, this program is going to change people's lives. I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat.\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Oh, cool. Cool. And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house for the night. Awkward. That's... You know what. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?\n",
      "Really? You seriously said that? Okay. Brenda, could Jan and I have a moment alone?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "I'll see you later.\n",
      "I'll call you later.\n",
      "That's like...\n",
      "I'll call you, too. [to Brenda] So. You are probably gonna get carded, so I can make you a fake ID. We have a laminating machine.\n",
      "What is a sales department? Oscar, what do you think?\n",
      "I'm not giving you the answer. Deck hands is one. And...\n",
      "Oh, oh, can I be the first mate?\n",
      "No, I'm first mate. You're second mate. I'm first mate, as the captain.\n",
      "How about the anchor?\n",
      "Well, the anchor is the only thing that kind of slows the ship down. Toby is the anchor. Oh, God. He, well... [to Brenda] Tell you about Toby later, he's awful.\n",
      "Oh, hey, Toby. So... It's an analogy.\n",
      "[Toby running to get on the cruise] Hey! What's wrong with you? You missed the boat.\n",
      "Idiot.\n",
      "No, no, no. That's his punishment for not being here on time. Too bad, anchor!\n",
      "On the high seas, Captain Jack is the leader. On the land it's Michael. On the ramp up to the boat, I was a bit conflicted. But now that I'm here, I'll follow Captain Jack to hell and back.\n",
      "Hey, Captain Jack, what kind of fish they got in this lake?\n",
      "You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...\n",
      "If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.\n",
      "Your problem now, Captain Jack.\n",
      "Hey. You know what the best way of studying is?\n",
      "Flash cards.\n",
      "You are gonna get seasick if you keep reading in here.\n",
      "That is a great way to kill this party. Not on my watch. Let's, uh,... Let's rock. Let's rock some stuff here, okay? [playing badly] Okay... I'm hearing a little too much reverb. [feedback echoing] Can we down the reverb? All right. Follow my lead. [playing Smoke on the Water] Does you guys know that? Take the bass. Take the drums. What?\n",
      "You know what? I don't think it's in...\n",
      "That's not in tune. I don't know if you can...\n",
      "...make much of out of it, Creed. Good luck to you. I don't know. It is a defective ax, my friend.\n",
      "Good luck.\n",
      "Those slide moves are just bush league. I hope I die before I'm old.\n",
      "You've been to the lake before?\n",
      "Yes, you should have.\n",
      "Love you.\n",
      "No, I really don't want to.\n",
      "Yeah! Toast!\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...\n",
      "Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?\n",

      "Ok...\n",

      "OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.\n",
      "You burned\n",
      "I enjoy having breakfast in bed.  I like waking up to the smell of bacon, sue me.  And since I don't have a butler, I have to do it myself.  So, most nights before I go to bed, I will lay six strips of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill.  Then I go to sleep.  When I wake up, I plug in the grill, I go back to sleep again.  Then I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon.  It is delicious, it's good for me.  It's the perfect way to start the day.  Today I got up, I stepped onto the grill and it clamped down on my foot... that's it.  I don't see what's so hard to believe about that.\n",
      "Pam, could you come get me?!\n",
      "Uh, I have to stay here and answer the phone.\n",
      "Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?\n",
      "There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?\n",

      "Morning everyone.  Don't freak out. I forbid anybody to freak out.  Clearly, I have had a very serious accident, but I will recover, God willing.  I just want to be treated normally today.  Normal would actually be good, considering the trauma that I've been through.\n",
      "You missed two big conference calls today, one with corporate.\n",
      "Did you explain why?\n",
      "No, I didn't mention that you cooked your foot.\n",

      "Sorry.\n",
      "It's just that before, you said that you didn't want any special treatment.\n",

      "Do you want some aspirin, because you seem a little fussy.\n",
      "No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.\n",

      "No, nope, no one is helping me out at all Mom.  No, I'm not gonna call Jan.  She'd just worry... drive down here and make a big thing... Who told you that?  No, it was mutual.  What is Pam doing chatting with you?\n",

      "So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.\n",
      "No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him. [Dwight falls towards Jim]\n",

      "Hi Dwight.\n",
      "Ahhh.  Mweehaa\n",
      "Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?\n",
      "Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.\n",
      "What is that?\n",
      "Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?\n",
      "Ok, what kinda machine is that?\n",

      "Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.\n",
      "I can't believe he's getting a CAT scan.\n",
      "Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.\n",
      "Really? Michael went in with him?\n",
      "Uh huh.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.\n",
      "Ok, that's uh, good news [Pam sees Angela eavesdropping] Uh, yeah, no I'll let you go.\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Ok. Bye.\n",
      "Bye.\n",
      "Hey, Oscar?\n",
      "I just wanted to let you that Dwight's gonna be ok.  The doctor said there's a really simple treatment for a concussion, so he'll probably even be back at work tomorrow.\n",
      "I just, uh, thought you'd want to know that.\n",
      "Uh, that's what she said.  See, haven't lost my sense of humor.  No, no need, it was a non-stick grill.\n",
      "I've had a Foreman grill for about six years, I've done about 85% of my cooking on it, but I've never burnt myself, probably because I don't use it as a pillow.\n",
      "I always keep a stash of bubble wrap at my house.  Some days, hectic, tiring days, I just like to go home and zone out and click on the tube and pop a few.  Very soothing.  [to the interviewer] Want to try?\n",
      "You know, that's probably not gonna last too long, you should go to a hospital and get a real cast.\n",
      "Right, I'm gonna spend the day in the hospital, bujehh.  Bureaucracy and germs.\n",
      "And doctors.\n",
      "Yes, so, no thank you.\n",
      "Pssht.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Constructing a home-made cast?  Genius.  Filled with foresight.  Like in the pioneer times, if you lost a leg, they would then use the bone of the leg for a cane.  They wasted nothing.\n",
      "Wow, I don't want to hear... you talk.  Pam, could I have a word with you in my office?  [stumbling] Oh, oh, oh.  Alright.\n",
      "Yeah, I've been sayin that.\n",

      "Look, I feel fine.  As a volunteer sheriff's deputy I have been trained to notice all the signs of a concussion.  One of them is slurred speech, ok?  Number three, shortness of breath.  There are four things you have to remember.  One: I am faster than 80% of all snakes.  Also.\n",
      "Into a machine?!  Ok. Uh, that's bad, will you stay with me?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Ok, will you please call my cousin Mose?\n",

      "There are several different ways to tell if a perp is lying. The liar will avoid direct eye contact. The liar will cover part of his or her face with his hands, especially the mouth.  The liar will perspire.  Unfortunately I spoke to Oscar on the phone so none of this is useful.\n",

      "Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.\n",
      "Ok. So what is the secret Michael?\n",
      "Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.\n",

      "Oh nonsense [lifts leg and puts it on Jim's desk], no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.\n",
      "No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.\n",
      "Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.\n",

But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.\n",
      "Oh, I think it's going to work out great. Because managing the warehouse is a very important part of my job. And I haven't been there in months.\n"

      "You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.\n",

      "Check this out! Look at that! Look at that [squeezes blow-up doll] bwup-bwa! [talks in girly voice] Hello! How are... [regular voice] Oh! Kay. That is great. That is good stuff.\n",

It was just something I read in this book when I was twelve. The girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom and she planted flowers on it and I just loved that. Just always kind of stuck with me.\n",

      "Yeah.\n",

      "Ahhh! Excellent.\n",
      "Is it good to be back. Yeah. I mean I love the guy stuff but to run an office you need men and women. You know why? Because you need to have that crazy sexual tension to keep things interesting.\n",
      "Dunder Mifflin. This is Pam. Uh... hold, please.\n",
      "Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.\n",
      "You did?\n",
      "And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Which one of these is coolest? What do you think? [classical piano playing] [violin playing]\n",

      "Do you mean vibrate?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.\n",
      "Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!\n",
      "What are you guys talking about?\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "Working on it.\n",
      "Yup.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit! [Darryl's office window shatters] Sorry.\n",
      "There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, 'There's no place like home.' And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called? [sighs] It's gonna drive me crazy.\n",
      "I really like Valentine's Day in this office. It's kinda like grade school. Everybody gives out little presents and stuff. Like last year, Jim gave me this card, with Dwight's head on it, it was horrifying and funny and...\n",

      "And you want me to come with you.\n",
      "Nope. The opposite of that.\n",
      "I will stay here and run things on this end.\n",
      "Ok, good.\n",
      "Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?\n",
      "I probably will, why do you ask?\n",
      "Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know...\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Screwed.\n",
      "What\n",
      "This is a business trip. I would have to be a raving lunatic to try to talk to Jan about what happened between us. Her words, not mine. She sent me an email this morning. But, it is Valentine's Day. It's New York. City of Love.\n",
      "Hey, Pam. You heart N.Y., right? You want me to pick you up anything?\n",
      "That's OK.\n",
      "Alright.\n",
      "Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!\n",
      "Well here we go. On our way to New York. New York, New York. City so nice they named it twice. Manhattan is the other name.\n",
      "So I broke up with Katy and haven't been dating anybody else, so this year I don't have to worry about Valentine's Day. It's gonna be good. I invited a couple of friends over. We're gonna play some cards and I'll end up winning a lotta money. Because, they're idiots. It's gonna be great.\n",
      "What's this? What is this?\n",
      "I dunno, it's on\n",
      "Yeah, but who put it here? And for what purpose?\n",
      "It was there when I sat down.\n",
      "[opens box and reads card] Happy Valentine's Day. [pulls out bobble head] It's me. I'm the bobble head. Yes! [Angela smirks in background] Ahh!\n",
      "The meeting isn't 'til three, but I always like to come to New York little bit early and hit some of my favorite hunts, like right here, is my favorite New York pizza joint. And I'm gonna go get me a New York slice. [Michael walks toward Sbarro.]\n",
      "Hey Kelly. What's up?\n",
      "OH, that's great. I'm really happy for [starts to walk away]\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "No, don't be.\n",
      "I bet.\n",
      "Alright. [Kelly squeals]\n",
      "Here it is, heart of New York City, Times Square. Named for the good times you have when you're in it. Most people when they come to New York, they go straight to the Empire State Building, that's pretty touristy. I come here. Great places to eat. [points] We have Bubba Gump Shrimp, Red Lobster down there. Ya know. This is, this is the heart of civilization, right here.\n",
      "Guess what?\n",
      "That's great. [Meredith scowls]\n",

      "This is the world famous Rockefeller Center. Founded, of course by Theodore Rockefeller. This is a skating rink and I think the Rangers practice there sometimes and it's, that's Tina Fey [points]. That's Tina Fey from Saturday Night Live. Hello? Hello, hi? [walks over] OH, I'm sorry, I thought you were [Conan O'Brien walks in front of Michael], OK, I thought that was. She, she looked a lot like Tina Fey. [to camera] Hello, hello, I thought that was Tina Fey, but it wasn't. So... Are you serious? He was here? When, when I was talking to the fake Tina Fey? Come on! And are you, argh.\n",
      "Hello Angela. Did you hear, somebody rocked the house and got me the best present I've ever gotten.\n",
      "Oh I did. I did.\n",
      "Oh, I bet you will before the day is over.\n",
      "I would love to live in New York someday. It's a big dream of mine. Work for corporate, with Jan. It'd be awesome. Go to Broadway shows, eat hot dogs. Scranton is great, but New York, is like Scranton on acid, no on speed, no on steroids. [Michael sees it's the end of a street.] OK, umm, I think, that's either the Hudson or the East, so we're back,  should be back this way. There's a lotta pressure on me right now. It's like Michael Jordan, in the NBA finals. Or, like Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, and this presentation is desert storm and as soon as it's over, we will not have to deal with those Iraqis anymore. Let's do it.\n",
      "[on phone] Nah that's alright. Spend money on her, instead of giving it to us. That's fine. No, I didn't even have a seat for you anyway. Yeah, hahaha, alright man, have a good night. Bye.\n",
      "OH, Holy God!\n",
      "There they are. What's up? Hey hey.\n",
      "Josh Porter, high five. [They high five] Bam.\n",
      "Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers. [bump fists]\n",
      "You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?\n",
      "So what's going on? What I miss?\n",
      "Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and... [awkward silence]\n",
      "Pam. Hi, How ya doing? Good. Listen, uh may I speak with you... privately?\n",
      "You can't fire me, Dwight, just 'cause Michael's not here.\n",
      "No, Pam, Just. Just, [tilts head away, towards another room]\n",
      "You need to get something for your girlfriend.\n",
      "[same time as Pam] Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of...\n",
      "Tightly wound?\n",
      "(smirking) Exactly.\n",
      "Ok, well, sometimes the gift is really about the gesture, you know, like what it means, instead of what it is.\n",
      "You mean, like a ham?\n",
      "No, not like a ham. It's about doing something, so that the person knows that you really care about her.\n",
      "Ok, I get it.\n",
      "That you remember her.\n",
      "Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do. [gets up and leaves]\n",
      "Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.\n",
      "Maybe because she's my girlfriend. [starts retracting statement] Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...\n",
      "You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,\n",
      "Yeah, yeah.\n",
      "Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need... [Ryan walks in]\n",
      "[under breath] Oh, no, not while I'm here.\n",
      "Ditto. [to Jan] How are you Jan?\n",
      "What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more. [plays video on screen. David and Jan have confused looks on their faces.]\n",
      "[video dialogue for 'The Faces of Scranton'] Life moves a little slower in Scranton, Pennsylvania. And that's the way we like it. Because at Dunder Mifflin Scranton, we're not just in the paper business, we're in the people business. Let's meet some of the folks that make the Scranton branch so special. [video shows Stanley at desk] This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.\n",
      "Yeah, I shot a bunch of footage around the office, edited it together on my Mac. I was thinking of entering it into some festivals. Probably won't. You know, not what this is about.\n",
      "[video dialogue] And finally, Pam Beesly. Look at her. Look how cute. Not bad at all. As the receptionist, Pam is truly the gateway to our world. Well, I hope this gave you a little taste of what life is like here at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. What it's like to walk a mile in Oscar's shoes. Or try on Phyllis' pants.  Maybe even one of Angela's famous brownies. And you'll know, that you're home. [video says, 'Great Scott!']\n",
      "Questions?\n",
      "Yes, thank you.\n",

      "You know what? Here's the deal, Kelly. It would be really nice if he was in to you, right? It'd be great, but he isn't.\n",
      "Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.\n",
      "Oh, ok. Alright.\n",
      "No you're not.\n",
      "Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...\n",
      "Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.\n",
      "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.\n",
      "Women are like wolves. If you want a wolf, you have to trap it. You have to snare it. And then you have to tame it. Keep it happy. Care for it. Feed it. Lovingly, the way an animal deserves to be loved. And my animal deserves a lot of loving.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "I guess, yeah.\n",
      "Nothing, it's just I had to sit here all day, while Phyllis got like an entire garden delivered to her.\n",
      "I mean, I know that we said no big gifts, but I was kind of hoping you'd get me\n",
      "No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously. [Jan looks at Michael]\n",
      "I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool. [David grins]\n",
      "I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.\n",
      "Heading out?\n",
      "Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day.\n",
      "Bye. [Jim leaves]\n",

      "Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.\n",
      "Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day. [Jan turns and then kisses Michael. Michael looks and sees camera, Jan turns and sees camera, too. Elevator door closes.]\n",
      "Oy vey... schmear. [Points at Fiddler on the Roof playing at Minskoff Theatre and does a dance.]\n",
      "Everybody, hello, can I have your attention, please? Since it's Valentine's Day, there's something that I wanted to say. I love the women of this office. Pam, I love you.\n",
      "Michael's got a few tricks for Valentine's Day. He found a place where you can get 12 plastic roses for $10 and he's got a great line. 'Me so thorny.'\n",
      "I love you, Angela. Yes, even you. I love you, Kelly. I love you, Meredith. This is all platonically, of course.\n",
      "I love ladies, always have. And you know what I think is the most attractive part of a woman's body? The brains. Because I don't think a woman is beautiful unless she is smart. And also, the brains are where the ladies get their best nasty ideas for bedroom stuff.\n",
      "You have any big Valentine's Day plans, Kev?\n",
      "Where is she?\n",
      "Cool.\n",
      "That's a lot of noodles. How much sodium do you think is in that cup? This place used to be full of hookers and porn shops and it's not that way anymore. There's an old building. That one hasn't been torn down yet, but they will. They'll get to it.\n",
      "This is where it's all happening. We got TGI Fridays. I'm in the picture! Sometimes I just jump into people's pictures. Lot of people have their picture taken. It's kind of a New Yorker thing. You jump in on a tourist's picture and kind of ruin it. There's an energy to New York that you just feel. Um, everybody... Don't get hit. Everybody is kind of together and everybody hates each other, but loves each other at the same time. Screw off! People just yell at each other in New York, and it's great.\n",
      "I'm gonna spend it with my fiance.\n",
      "What are you guys doing?\n",
      "Nice.\n",
      "Okay, okay. That's enough.\n",
      "Come on, break this up.\n",
      "Great. Thank you.\n",
      "Okay, here's the thing about Jan. She talks such a big game about, 'Oh there's nothing between us and stop talking about it.' And 'Border-line harassment when you call me at home.' But let me ask you this, is it just a coincidence that this meeting is taking place on Valentine's Day? Answer, maybe, but maybe not. We shall see.\n",
      "How do you spell 'animalian'?\n",
      "Animalian?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "None of your business. I'm writing something.\n",
      "You're writing something?\n",

      "Okay.\n",
      "No, you know what? You do it.\n",
      "No, I'm not gonna do that.\n",
      "Uh, yes, I'm in charge. You have to. Look it up.\n",
      "But I know how to spell it.\n",
      "So tell me.\n",
      "Only if you tell me what you're writing.\n",

      "You know what? It was nice to see Devon again. To sort of get closure on that whole thing.\n",
      "Let's think this through. If we ask Corporate for that then...\n",

      "Can we not?\n",
      "No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long. [Michael starts playing with a football in the office] Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh! [laughs] Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.\n",
      "Still want that.\n",

      "Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Question: Do their pizzas play DVDs?\n",
      "Dwight was the top salesman of the year at our company. He wins a little prize money and gets honored at some convention. It is literally the highest possible honor that a Northeastern Pennsylvania-Based Mid-size Paper Company Regional Salesman can attain, so...\n",
      "What did I do to deserve this?\n",
      "Are you sad that Dwight beat you?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Are you going to cry, Jim? Do you need a tissue?\n",
      "Oh! I... uh... yeah. Um... I'll uh show them to you later.\n",
      "Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.\n",
      "Ok, cool.\n",
      "I have a ton of stuff to do for the wedding. And I have to do it in the office. And that can be kind of awkward. Um... just because people can get all weird about wedding stuff. Then... I just... I don't want to offend... Angela... or someone.\n",
      "That's what she said!\n",
      "Ha! I don't get it.\n",
      "Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?\n",
      "Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?\n",
      "Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.\n",
      "Speaker at the Sales Convention. Been there, done that. Went there again, did it again. Two years in a row. Consecutive. I just... I miss the feeling of knowing that you did a good job because someone gives you proof of it. Sir, you're awesome! Here's a plaque. What, a whole year has gone by and you need more proof? Here's a certificate. They stopped making plaques that year.\n",
      "What if I give a really long, extended Thank You. For instance, 'Thank you, Mr. Blank. Thank you very, very, very...'\n",
      "That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.\n",
      "When I was in the sixth grade, I was a finalist in our school Spelling Bee. It was me against Raj Patel. And I misspelled, in front of the entire school, the word 'failure'.\n",
      "I can't do this.\n",
      "That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.\n",
      "Oh, okay.\n",
      "But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.\n",
      "Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.\n",
      "Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.\n",
      "I'll try and think of one. When...\n",
      "Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.\n",

      "I'm going to take a trip. I'm going to get out of town for a while... and go someplace... not here.\n",

      "[stand up comic voice] But seriously, what's the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?\n",
      "Saleswoman has a vagina.\n",
      "It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.\n",
      "But I'm right?\n",
      "Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right? [stand up comic voice] The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!\n",
      "Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?\n",
      "I do. Both of them.\n",
      "Could I have a copy of one of them?\n",
      "No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.\n",
      "Attention everybody! Attention please! I have some very great news from Corporate. We had a wonderful quarter and as a result all of you are getting bonuses for 1000 dollars!\n",
      "Yeah!\n",

      "You see that? You see how they responded to me? In that moment, I had them.\n",
      "That is so great about the bonus!\n",
      "No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.\n",
      "Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.\n",
      "Do we know anyone who was in the accident?\n",
      "Brad Pitt. Also there will be no bonuses.\n",
      "They are unrelated.\n",
      "He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.\n",
      "As your leader and your friend, I sort of demand that you can all speak in public as I can... and did... twice. [speaking to camera] You saw the plaque, right? [to office] All right. We're all going to go around the room and we're going to make toasts. And that way, we will overcome our fear of public speaking.\n",

      "No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme?\n",
      "Alright, let me explain. Again. [draws on board] Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's...

Anyway, after the opening act this beautiful girl sits down next to me and I never get to meet girls with lip rings and she had one. I don't know exactly how this happened but one of her friends started passing around some stuff and they said it was clove cigarettes, and I'm sure that it was clove cigarettes. Everybody in the aisle was doing it.\n",

These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you. [Jim shakes his head no] It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you. [Jim stands up] Oh, he's doing it, okay. [Jim looks at Pam] It's okay. [Jim pretends to try, looking teary eyed, shakes his head no, mouths 'I can't' and sits back down. Pam is amazed.] Oh.

      "Yes, I will not be.\n",
      "You will be. That is the law according to the rules.\n",
      "Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.\n",

[employees mumble 'merely listen to and forgotten...' ] That is outrageous! I love this place... and it pains me to see all of the negativity festering... [sighs] Okay, today we are going to get everything out of these files and into the open, where it can be resolved. Alright, how about the Phyllis/Angela dispute?\n",
      "That's what she said. [Jim mouths these words along with Michael] The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does 'redacted' mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked 'redacted'... ?\n",

      "Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.\n",
      "You're so immature!\n",
      "Ah.\n",
      "Hey, Jan.\n",
      "Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.\n",
      "The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.\n",
      "Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.\n",
      "Mm-hmm.\n",
      "This party is going to be awesome.\n",
      "I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.\n",
      "Check it out.\n",
      "That is crooked on that side.\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Hey hey!\n",
      "That is a lot of liquor.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "And a dart board.\n",
      "Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.\n",
      "Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?\n",
      "Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.\n",
      "Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.\n",
      "I'll do a shot, Michael.\n",
      "Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.\n",
      "SWAG! Stuff we all get. I basically decorated my condo for free with all of my SWAG.\n",

      "Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.\n",
      "I'm a huge fan.\n",
      "You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.\n",
      "Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?\n",
      "So maybe. See ya.\n",
      "Why do they call him The Bus?\n",
      "Because he's afraid to fly.\n",
      "Smile!\n",
      "Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!\n",
      "Yep. Yeah, she's up front.\n",
      "You don't have email on your phone.\n",
      "I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?\n",
      "No one just called you.\n",
      "All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.\n",
      "[into phone] See you in a bit. Bye-bye. [to Dwight] May I have a moment of your time please?\n",
      "I need you to do something for me.\n",
      "Yes. Anything.\n",
      "I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.\n",
      "I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.\n",
      "Hey! What's up?\n",
      "[answering phone] Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam. He's not in the office. Can I take a message? I will. You too. [hangs up] Sorry. What's up?\n",
      "Okay. Well, if you think of it, I'll be here.\n",
      "So I called my buddy down at the station today. Had them run a background check on Josh Porter. See if there's any known aliases, et cetera.\n",
      "And?\n",
      "He wasn't volunteering today.\n",
      "Business has been pretty crazy around the office.\n",
      "Oh yeah?\n",
      "Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.\n",
      "Oh, tell him I say hi.\n",
      "I will call him later with that message.\n",
      "Hey, how is... Toby?\n",
      "Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?\n",
      "Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to...\n",
      "Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.\n",
      "Michael, it's really not a competition.\n",
      "Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.\n",
      "Whoa. Michael.\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "Was that your per diem?\n",
      "No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.\n",
      "I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.\n",
      "The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.\n",
      "Any messages for 308? All right.\n",
      "Hey hey, fellers.\n",
      "Michael.\n",
      "Hey, Michael.\n",
      "What's up?\n",
      "Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.\n",
      "Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.\n",
      "Okay! Excellent. Oh...\n",
      "Keep the wing flaps.\n",
      "Shut it. [answering phone] Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes. [to others] Say hi to Pam!\n",
      "Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim. [to others] Pam says hi. [into phone] Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.\n",
      "You first.\n",
      "Come on. Nice try, Josh!\n",
      "Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.\n",
      "Well, let's...\n",
      "Come on!\n",
      "Come on!\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "Jim and I have different definitions of friendship. I think it's talking and being friends, and Jim thinks it's moving to Connecticut and being best friends with Josh. Well, phooey on that. I, uh, I'm done. I am not going to be speaking with him anymore. Whatevs. Long-distance relationships never work.\n",
      "Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.\n",
      "Sorry, my meeting ran late.\n",
      "Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.\n",
      "Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.\n",
      "Yes! Ha!\n",
      "Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.\n",
      "Dwight's room key. And... Dwight's room. What can I say? Old habits die hard.\n",
      "Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!\n",
      "So how do you come up with your cartoons?\n",
      "You dream in cartoons? How fun!\n",
      "Hey, first guest! You are going to have some tequila, my friend.\n",
      "This is the party.\n",
      "Party central! So, what can I do you for? [Guy leaves] All right.\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Freedom fries. Yeah.\n",
      "Well, it was, uh, it was really nice meeting you, Alan.\n",
      "More freedom fries.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "I went on a date. It wasn't a love connection, um... I think when I like someone again, I'll just kinda know.\n",
      "Michael. Am I the first to arrive?\n",
      "People have been filtering in and out.\n",
      "Can I get a drink?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Can I get a drink?\n",
      "Sure. You like Cosmos?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?\n",
      "Michael...\n",
      "I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...\n",
      "Wait, wait. I didn't transfer because of you. You're a good boss. You're a great boss.\n",
      "I'm not better than Josh.\n",
      "Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.\n",
      "Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.\n",
      "No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.\n",
      "I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.\n",
      "Nope, that's okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "That's all right.\n",
      "I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.\n",
      "Yeah. Okay, maybe.\n",
      "Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Evan, this is Jim.\n",
      "How are you?\n",
      "Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?\n",
      "No, we used to. Now we're friends.\n",
      "Best friends.\n",
      "Some people need dozens of friends to say, 'Hey, look at me, I'm popular.' But not me. I'm very picky. I need three, maybe two. When you meet that someone special, you'll just know. Because a real relationship, it... it can't be forced. It should just come about effortlessly.\n",
      "Now, would you do the pleasure of hitting the lights, sir? [lights go out, leaving Michael's black light on] Ha, ha, ha.\n",
      "Ha, ha, ha, ha.\n",

      "What are you doing?\n",
      "You said you didn't know how to say it.\n",
      "I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.\n",

      "Oohh... can you imagine how much blood there was?  If it happened right here, it would reach all the way to reception.  Probably get on Pam.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!\n",
      "Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!\n",
      "There are five stages to grief, which are [glancing at computer screen] denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  And right now, out there, they're all denying the fact that they're sad.  And that's   hard.  And it's making them all angry.  And it is my job to try to get them all the way through to acceptance.  And if not acceptance, then just depression.  If I can get them depressed, then I'll have done my job.\n",

When you catch the ball, I want you to say the name of a person very important to you, somebody really special who died, and then I want you to say how they died, and you may cry if you like, that is encouraged.  Let me just start.  Let me show you how this works.   I catch the ball.  I lost Ed Truck.  And... it feels like somebody took my heart and dropped it into a bucket of boiling tears... and at the same time, somebody else is hitting my soul in the crotch with a frozen sledgehammer... and then a third guy walks in and starts punching me in the grief bone... and I'm crying, and nobody can hear me, because I am terribly, terribly... terribly alone.\n",
      "Okay, fine.  Hurry back.\n",
      "Oh.  I would like a break.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "I think so.  I don't know, I was mainly focused on the cup holders.\n",

You have 'em in the warehouse.  Great.  What is my store number... six.  Wait, no.  I'll call you back. [quickly hangs up] Shut up [to Karen].\n",

When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.\n",

First off, I want you to be comfortable, because you really can't grieve if you're all tight and buttoned up. So, guys, loosen your ties, just take your jackets off if you want. Ladies, let your hair down. You know what? Even take your shoes off. I wanna get personal and I want you all to really open up. And I want you to know that anything and everything can be said.\n",

To understand me, you have to know that I work in the city, but I live here on this small, beautiful farm. It's a family farm. Many Schrutes were born here and many of us end up here. My grandfather was a good man who did some very bad things. What the... Damn it! Those kids! [discovers two teenagers naked, running] You! You, get out of here! This is not a cheap motel! This is a farm and cemetery! Freaks! You're lucky I don't have my crossbow! Let me show you the compost pile.\n",

Well, to have Kelly explain it [girly voice] it's ada blah blah blah, it's so super fun and it's going to be great. [normal voice] Lot of gods with unpronounceable names.

      "Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.\n",

      "Diwali is a very important holiday for the Hindus. But, frankly, I'm a little appalled that none of you know very much about Indian culture. So, without further ado, Kelly you are on.\n",
      "Kelly?\n",
      "Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.\n",
      "Pam wishes. [generalized laughing] Kelly, I'll take this one. Diwali is a Celebration of the Coronation of the God-King Rama. After his epic battle with Ravana, the Demon King of Lanka. It symbolizes the battle between good and evil...\n",
      "All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.\n",
      "Sorry.\n",
      "I started biking into work. Josh does it and he lives a lot farther away than I do. And also it saves gas money, keeps me in shape... helps the environment. And now I know it makes me really sweaty for work.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Now, a lot of people say that Kelly is one in a million and that's true, but it's also not true. Because, frankly, there are literally billions of people just like Kelly in the world.  Here are some famous Indians. [slide show] Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. He is a Nobel prize-winning physicist. Impressive. Apu from the Simpsons. Hilarious. Indian. M. Night Shyamalan.

      "Scuse me?\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Yup.\n",
      "And another thing about the Indian people... they love sex positions. I present to you the Kama Sutra. I mean look at that. Who's seen that before?\n",
      "Thank you, Kevin.\n",
      "Well, I find it beautiful.\n",
      "No...\n",
      "No, You're not going to collect them.\n",
      "No. This is delightful, charming culture.\n",
      "My Indian Culture Seminar was going great until Toby decided that he was too immature to deal with culturally explicit images. It's just sex. People... everybody does it. I'm doing it... with Carol! Probably tonight.\n",
      "Once a quarter, the sales staff at this branch has to stay late to do order form consolidation... which, amazingly, is even less interesting than it sounds.\n",

      "[points at woman] What does that look like to you?\n",
      "No one's even going to notice.\n",
      "Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.\n",

      "No. These s'mores are disgusting.\n",
      "Do you think they have any s'mores?\n",
      "All they are is chocolate, graham cracker, and marshmallow. How difficult would that have been?\n",
      "Very official.\n",

[cracks himself up] ... We laughed so hard... It was hilarious... oh... [calms down] So yes, I'm very excited about the Diwali party.\n",
      "Does Michael talk about\n",
      "He does? What does he say.\n",
      "Nope, I got eel.\n",
      "And perhaps the most important person to Indian culture, Sir Ben Kingsley. Because of him, the British left India, and then he became an actor like Ronald Reagan.\n",
      "Michael?\n",
      "Yeah?\n",
      "Your shirt is buttoned wrong.\n",
      "So, any questions?\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.\n",
      "I don't have a ton of contact with the Scranton branch, but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationery, so, from time to time, I send Dwight faxes. From himself. From the future. [reading fax] 'Dwight, at 8 A.M. today, someone poisons the coffee. Do not drink the coffee. More instructions will follow. Cordially, Future Dwight.'\n",
      "No![knocks coffee out of Stanley's hand.] You'll thank me later.\n",
      "There she is - Jan Levinson. First...\n",
      "...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.\n",
      "[singing] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I don't understand.\n",
      "On whom's authority?\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You're welcome.\n",
      "Am I a small number person or a severance package person?\n",
      "Oh... [burrys head in hands] Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.\n",
      "Well...\n",
      "Oh, you gotta be... Josh?\n",
      "Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?\n",
      "It is an outrage, that's all. It's... hey're making a huge, huge mistake. Let's see Josh replace these people. Let's see Josh find another Stanley. You think Stanleys grow on trees? Well they don't. There is no Stanley tree. Do you think the world is crawling with Phyllises? Show me that farm. With Phyllises and Kevins sprouting up all over the place. Ripe for the plucking. Show me that farm.\n",
      "Pictures. Memories. [Picks up a framed photo of Stanley's daughter from Stanley's desk] Look at that. They grow up so fast.\n",
      "Hey stranger.\n",
      "Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.\n",
      "Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.\n",
      "Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.\n",
      "Really? Wow... that's bad.\n",
      "Well, I work here now.\n",
      "Are you okay?\n",
      "Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.\n",
      "What did Jan want?\n",
      "Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...\n",
      "What can't you tell me?\n",
      "Nothing, Pam.[whispers to himself] What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "What?\n",
      "You just said that we're gonna be gone...?\n",
      "Do I have any messages?\n",
      "Michael, what's going on?\n",
      "Ok, ok...\n",
      "[facing the whole office] Listen up, everybody... I have some news. We are screwed. Dunder-Mifflin, Scranton is being shut down.\n",
      "You knew about this all along, didn't you?\n",
      "Traitor. You are a traitor.\n",
      "I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.\n",
      "I worked in Scranton for a really long time. And uh, it's going to be weird that it's all disappearing. I mean, I always knew that the branch would shut down someday. I just figured it would be because Michael sold the building for some magic beans.\n",
      "It's a blessing in disguise. Actually, not even in disguise. Sometimes at home, I answer the phone, 'Dunder-Mifflin, this is Pam.' So, maybe that'll stop now.\n",
      "Darryl. Noble Darryl. [sighs]\n",
      "I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.\n",
      "So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...\n",
      "Awesome.\n",
      "This is my house. The CFO is taking away my house and giving it to Josh. And Josh is giving the garage to Bob Vance.\n",
      "All right, listen up. Some of you may have heard some rumors about the branch closing. But, I am not going to take this lying down. I have a plan and I am going to save our jobs. So just hang in there. [Looks at  Dwight] Let's go.\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "Oh, good... you're bringing Dwight.\n",
      "Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.\n",
      "What's the plan?\n",
      "Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.\n",
      "Can I drive?\n",
      "No... way.\n",
      "Shotgun!\n",
      "No. There's no one else.\n",
      "Still.\n",
      "Thank you very much. [hangs up cell phone] Okay, secretary says Wallace is away for the day and won't be coming back into the office.\n",
      "Okay, okay. Um...\n",
      "But, do not worry. I have his home address right [presses cell phone button] here.\n",
      "Why?\n",
      "Christmas card list.\n",
      "You sent him cards? You never met him.\n",
      "But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.\n",
      "Hey, do you have a second?\n",
      "I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?\n",
      "Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?\n",
      "What does that mean?\n",
      "Okay, this is it. [runs up the stairs of CFO's house, with Dwight] This is exactly what Michael Moore does, famous documentarian. He goes up to people with a camera and he's like 'Why did you do this? Why did you pollute? You are bad. You're a bad person.' It's very dramatic.  Although, I can't say I was a big fan of  'Bowling for Columbine', because I thought it was going to be a bowling movie, like 'Kingpin'. And it wasn't. It was something else.\n",
      "Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.\n",
      "So, do you know what you're gonna say when he shows up?\n",
      "I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.\n",
      "No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.\n",
      "Yes? What is the meaning of this?\n",
      "Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.\n",
      "Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.\n",
      "Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.\n",
      "[no longer talking to Dwight as Wallace] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.\n",
      "[as himself] Whoa hey, why not?\n",
      "Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Don't touch me this time.\n",
      "[as David Wallace] Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...\n",
      "Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?\n",
      "[frightened] Uh!\n",
      "Wow.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...\n",
      "No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Ah. [takes a gulp of Gatorade and passes the bottle to Michael] Here, replinish your fluids.\n",
      "[takes bottle and cleans off cap with his tie]\n",
      "He's not here. I don't know where he is.\n",
      "Is it because of Michael? Did he actually do something?\n",
      "Sure, uh, Jan... um, do you know, is anyone coming back to Scranton?\n",
      "Coming to Scranton. Is anyone coming to Scranton?\n",
      "[referring to Michael's ringing phone] who is it?\n",
      "The office.\n",
      "Gonna get it?\n",
      "No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.\n",
      "I guess some new people might be coming from Stamford. Should be fun. New blood.\n",
      "That's, um... I hadn't thought about it, huh.\n",
      "Yeah, that might be weird. Overall though, we still all have our jobs... so, good news, right?\n",
      "I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?\n",
      "You'd actually move to Scranton?\n",
      "New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?\n",
      "Anything?\n",
      "Nothing. [puts down binoculars]\n",
      "What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?\n",
      "Then it was an honor to have worked with you.\n",
      "[pats Dwight and sighs] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.\n",
      "My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.\n",
      "That was hilarious. The foam ...\n",
      "Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.\n",
      "Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.\n",
      "What were your favorite moments?\n",
      "Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.\n",
      "What about when Jan said the branch was closing?\n",
      "God, Dwight!\n",
      "Well, it doesn't...\n",
      "No thanks, guys.\n",
      "Have fun though.\n",
      "Really? Where did you hear that?\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah, me too.\n",
      "Maybe this is good. Finding another job is a pain. There's another annoying boss, another desk, I'd have to learn everything all over again. So, there are reasons to stay.\n",
      "Hey, um, I think I am gonna take that job. And Scranton... it's not that bad. So, if they offer you a job there, I think you should take it.\n",
      "Okay.\n",

      "So when do I get to hear everything? Are you still getting unpacked or... you want to grab a coffee or something after work?\n",
      "Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.\n",
      "Oh, yeah, no! You know. Whenever.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...\n",

      "How did you...\n",
      "People hate people that are different from them. That's natural. But you know what makes people forget their differences?  A great show. That is why I created the 'Integration Celebration'. This is the moment when Scranton and Stamford come together as one. United in applause.\n",
      "I know what a lot of you must be thinking. 'Wow! What a day! Feels more like a night at a party than a day at work.' Well, in my opinion, business should feel like a night out. A night... at... the Roxbury. Okay. There's supposed to be music and it's... I got it, I got it! I got it. Dwight! Just.\n",

      "Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.\n",

      "On three. One... two... three.\n",

      "Well, we'll squeeze you in.\n",
      "You can't quit! On the first day. That's [deep voice] heresy, my friend! [regular voice] Okay, let's talk about this. What happened? I mean, what... Was it Toby? Did he say something? Cause he's... what?\n",
      "My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?\n",
      "Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.\n",
      "You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!\n",
      "Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.\n",
      "That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him.\n",
      "Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.\n",
      "And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice? [whispers] Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.\n",
      "Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.\n",
      "No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.\n",
      "The word merger comes from the word marriage. And that was what today was supposed to be. The loving union between people. Instead, it has become like when my Mom moved in with Jeff. And once again, it becomes my job to fix it.\n",
      "Hey! Hey, everybody! Something happened! Those guys from Vance Refrigeration, they let the air out of our tires.\n",
      "What!\n",
      "Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!\n",
      "Does he ever.\n",
      "Man, they got us so bad. We cannot let them get away with this. We have got to pull together as one and steal their refrigerators.\n",
      "YEAH!\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Go home, Toby. Just...\n",
      "Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful. [reads note] 'You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!'\n",
      "No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...\n",
      "THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!\n",
      "See that? Mission accomplished. Like a bunch of fourth graders. Sometimes, what brings the kids together is hating the lunch lady. Although that'll change. Because, by the end of the fourth grade, the lunch lady was actually the person I hung out with the most. [answers phone] Jell-o!\n",
      "Hi, Jan!\n",
      "I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.\n",
      "So after a great deal of thought and introspective-shun, I have decided to make Jim my new Number Two.\n",
      "If he even wants it. It doesn't come with a pay raise.\n",
      "Yeah, it does, actually.\n",
      "So who will be your new Number Three?\n",
      "Uh... that I have not decided yet.\n",

      "Oh. That's totally cool. You can do whatever you want.\n",
      "O..ok. Um..good.\n",

      "Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.\n",
      "Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.\n",

      "Merry Christmas Dwight.\n",
      "Jim.\n",
      "Wow. What have we got here?\n",
      "What does it look like?\n",
      "Dead goose.\n",
      "And circle gets the square.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "[to Pam] So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk.\n",
      "No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.\n",
      "Once I brought in a duck. To prepare for lunch. And people got upset. Apparently, they got attached to the duck and didn't want to see it killed.\n",
      "He was already dead. And we Schrutes use every part of the goose. The meat has a delicious, smoky, rich flavor. Plus you can use the molten goose grease and save it in the refrigerator, thus saving you a trip to the store for a can of expensive goose grease.\n",
      "Wow. Win-Win.\n",
      "Exactly. Thank you, Jim.\n",
      "Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas.\n",
      "It's Christmas Toby.\n",

      "Wow. What kind of bike is that?\n",
      "Umm... I don't know? Average kind?\n",
      "Well, that is probably from the test drive.\n",
      "But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Oh, thanks. [Michael and Andy do a fist bump and explosion.]\n",
      "Michael?\n",
      "Yes? [Pam holds up a bag] Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.\n",

      "I know.\n",
      "Right.\n",
      "Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...\n",
      "And next to your kids. What?\n",
      "I don't understand?\n",
      "It's a bold move, to Photoshop yourself into a picture with your girlfriend and her kids on a ski trip with their real father. But then again, Michael's a bold guy. [Towards unseen cameraman] Is bold the right word?\n",
      "OK\n",
      "No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in [making drum noise] Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.\n",
      "I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. [Carol shakes head in disappointment]. You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.\n",
      "And it's all inclusive.\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.\n",
      "Psst. Jim. [Jim turns around. Pam nods head towards her for him to come over] Um, hey. I need to give you your Christmas gift now because, well, I'll just tell you.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "For the past few months I've been sending Dwight letters from the CIA. [hands a folder to Jim]\n",
      "Are you serious?\n",
      "They're considering him for a top secret mission. There's his application. Oh, and this is where I made him list every secret he promised he'd never ever tell.\n",
      "[Opens folder and reads from Dwight's file] Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.\n",
      "So... here's the gift. You get to decide what his top secret mission is. [Jim smiles] Sorry I didn't wrap it.\n",
      "[closes folder] You know what? Uh, I really don't think I should be doing this stuff anymore, you know?\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "No, because of the promotion.\n",
      "Oh yeah.\n",
      "It just feels a little bit, like...\n",
      "No, I get it, of course. OK. [holds out hand for folder. Jim gives Pam back the folder.]\n",
      "I feel like there's a chance for me to start over. And if I fall back into the same kind of things I used to do., then ... what am I doing?\n",
      "I'd like everybody's attention. Christmas is canceled.\n",
      "Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.\n",
      "Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.\n",
      "Michael, what's going on?\n",
      "Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.\n",
      "Will they still air 'Rudolph?'\n",
      "[over everybody else's talking] Are we gonna cancel Hanukah as well?\n",
      "Fine! [everybody stops talking] Have your party. Just no guests.\n",
      "Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.\n",
      "Oh, oh, oh, oh, it hurts.\n",
      "I know.\n",
      "It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.\n",
      "OK, well, why are you laying like that?\n",
      "[moves a little] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?\n",
      "Like what?\n",
      "Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?\n",
      "Well.. um I, I don't...\n",
      "And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?\n",

      "Hey. You have a bunch of messages and... [sees Michael shaking head with beads in hair] that's nice. Hannah quit while you were gone. I guess she memo-ed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother? And so you might also have to be deposed.\n",
      "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.\n",
      "It's kind of serious.\n",
      "Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.\n",
      "How was Jamaica?\n",
      "It was\n",
      "Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.\n",
      "OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.\n",
      "Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...\n",
      "You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.\n",
      "You want to talk about it?\n",
      "Feelin' hot, hot, hot! [playing conch shell] Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.\n",
      "That's good. [Michael continues to play conch shell]\n",
      "You know, I had never been out of the country before now?\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.\n",
      "It's kind of an impoverished country.\n",
      "Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.\n",
      "But you can't today, we're doing inventory.\n",
      "Inventory's at the end of December.\n",
      "We couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.\n",
      "I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.\n",
      "Inventory is boring. In the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory. Why do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans?\n",
      "Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau. I want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin warehouse inventory. So, Party Planning Committee, get on it.\n",
      "The Jamaicans don't have a word for 'impossible.'\n",
      "Yep, it's English, it's 'impossible.'\n",
      "How hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers. That's all you need.\n",
      "Come on in. Settle in. Settling. Settling... and settled. Good, there is something I would like to show everybody. See this sign? [points to a TV monitor of a picture from Jamaica and reads] 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem.' This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here. So what, if we have to stay late to do inventory? No problem.\n",
      "Oh my God. Is that Jan? [points to same monitor]\n",
      "On the left.\n",
      "No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.\n",
      "Jan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it can get us both in trouble. So officially, I did not see her. But I did see Jan there. In our room. At night. And in the morning. That's all I'm gonna say. Sex. We had sex. I had sex with her. I had sex with Jan.\n",
      "[on phone] Hey dude. I just got back from Jamaica.\n",
      "Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.\n",
      "Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.\n",
      "Oh no?\n",
      "OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?\n",
      "Check it again. Hit refresh.\n",
      "OK, wait a second. I sent it to you at... [reading computer screen] Packer@DunderMifflin.com.\n",
      "Darryl?! Hey. Hi. Where's Darryl?\n",
      "OK, Hey, man, how's it going?\n",
      "That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?\n",
      "OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not 'packaging.' Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?\n",
      "OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.\n",
      "And you sent that out to everyone?\n",
      "Yikes.\n",
      "Fantastic.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "You OK?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "You sure?\n",
      "Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.\n",
      "Oh. You want to talk about it?\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "I have a special assignment for you.\n",
      "Who's the target?\n",
      "A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is 'Jamaican Jan Sun Princess.'\n",
      "What's it of?\n",
      "Not important.\n",
      "Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.\n",
      "OK, forget it.\n",
      "OK, I accept it.\n",
      "So, I dunno, I just feel likes we've been dating a month, right? Same street. I think that might be a little close. A little much.\n",
      "Hmm.\n",
      "Hmm, what?\n",
      "How far away does she live now, like ten minutes?\n",
      "Yeah, I guess.\n",
      "Honestly, I think you should go easy on her.\n",
      "No, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem. That's what friends do. I help Phyllis all the time. Just yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair. So, yeah.\n",
      "Hey, thanks a lot.\n",
      "Oh, don't worry about it. I mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell... which is what I was doing. Oh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan!\n",
      "Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping? [both start laughing]\n",
      "Not now, not ever.\n",
      "Aww, none of your business.\n",
      "That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.\n",
      "This is probably the icebreaker you need.\n",
      "I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.\n",
      "No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "[on phone] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Just a second. Michael, it's Jan on the phone for you.\n",
      "Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.\n",
      "He'll call you back. OK, great.\n",
      "She bought it? [Pam nods] OK. OK.\n",
      "[to Jim and Ryan] Michael hit a deer?\n",
      "Michael! Michael! [pokes head through blinds in Michael's office] There's an emergency in the warehouse.\n",
      "There an accident? Somebody hurt?\n",
      "No, it's... involves the photograph.\n",
      "Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.\n",
      "All right. [continued clapping and cheering for Michael]\n",
      "Hello. Hi. Attention everyone. Um, apparently, there is an email circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rating picture of me and a woman---\n",
      "No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...\n",
      "Urkel Grue.\n",
      "My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?\n",
      "Feelin'... feelin' hot, hot, hot! [plays conch shell]\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "Hey.\n",
      "What are you doing out here?\n",
      "Island living. You know?\n",
      "Jan called. She's coming in later to talk to you.\n",
      "Did she say what it's about?\n",
      "That's all she said.\n",
      "Uh, I think you dropped this [hands over piece of paper]\n",
      "Definitely.\n",
      "I have disconnected the office T1 line. I have ordered that that [referring to large picture of Michael and Jan in Jamaica on the wall] be taken down and destroyed all print outs from the bathroom.\n",
      "There are copies in the bathroom?\n",
      "There were. A lot of them.\n",
      "All right.\n",
      "Sorry?\n",
      "Oh, yeah, no. Don't worry about it. I mean, he was being ridiculous.\n",
      "Sure.\n",
      "Who did this to you? [refers to Pam crying] Where is he?\n",
      "What? No, it's not... it's nothing.\n",
      "[takes off coat to tie around waist] It's hot in here.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "[Dwight hands out handkerchief] Thanks. You don't need to stay here.\n",
      "I know. [puts arm around Pam who continues to cry] So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?\n",
      "Guh.\n",
      "OK, yup.\n",
      "I...\n",
      "I... I... Yes.\n",
      "OK, yeah.\n",
      "Who is Dr. Perry? I...\n",
      "And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.\n",
      "So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...\n",
      "Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate - [Jan leans over and kisses Michael passionately]\n",
      "Jan, you... complete... me.\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "I just had the best, most romantic week of my life in Sandals, Jamaica. Went with a lady, and we laid on the beach and drank fruity drinks for free, because it was all-inclusive. And then I flew back to Scranton, and then they lost one of my bags.\n",
      "Hey, Mister tally man, tally me banana, six hand, seven hand, eight hand, BRUNCH! [snickers] So delicious. Dinner, too. And every morning I would watch the sunrise and I would eat a mango. That is how I want to feel all the time. It's called island living. You know, how they say take a chill pill? In Jamaica, I took one. Guy on the beach sold it to me for $40. And after I finished vomiting, I was more relaxed than I ever have been. Lost six pounds, too. That's how I want every day to be.\n",
      "Michael sends me a postcard from every vacation he goes on. Atlantic City, he wishes I was here. Busch Gardens, Virginia, all I got was this lousy postcard. And this time, I'm Jamaican-him-crazy. I don't know how far away he thought he was, because he put $10 worth of stamps on this.\n",
      "Hello, you're back.\n",
      "Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.\n",
      "While you were gone...\n",
      "Me had an i-rey time.\n",
      "While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.\n",
      "Dwight, please, please.\n",
      "He turned over my...\n",
      "I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.\n",
      "I took a vacation once. Never again. While I was away, Jim had my desk shipped to me in Roswell.\n",
      "Presents. I got presents for everybody. Dwight, a genuine Rastafarian wig.\n",
      "Unbelievable.\n",
      "Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.\n",
      "You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied. [puts lei on Angela]\n",
      "Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.\n",
      "That's okay.\n",
      "I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!\n",
      "No.\n",
      "[laughs] Try it on.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.\n",
      "I just got back from vacay. Come on. Give me a break, man. [holds up CD] Waves over Jamaica, $6.99.\n",
      "Okay, let me tell you a little story. When I was on vacation, I met a man named Bavon. And Bavon takes people parasailing. And you know what he said to me? He said that he loves going to work every day. How many of you can say that you love going to work every day like Bavon? [Dwight and Andy raises hand] No one.\n",
      "His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.\n",
      "I would love to take them all to Jamaica, but is that good management? Yes. But is it the best management? Well, I can't afford it, and corporate won't pay for it. So who's the real criminal?\n",
      "How many of you know the meaning of the Jamaican term, Hakuna Matata?\n",
      "[raises hand] Are you stoned?\n",
      "I...\n",
      "In the picture, are you high?\n",
      "Oh, that's red eye.\n",
      "Is that not what happens when you're high?\n",
      "Well...\n",
      "Hey, can we just focus?\n",
      "Michael and Jan together in Jamaica. I guess I would just need a little bit more evidence than seeing it with my own eyes.\n",
      "Come on. Come on.\n",
      "Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.\n",
      "Try Dwight.\n",
      "Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.\n",
      "Don't you have some sort of chaser or gobbler thing that you can send out that's able to eat up that other emails? I read about something like that. Well, I am in America and I am online, so I do think it involves you. Uh-huh. And if I were a subscriber, would then you be able to send out the gobbler? I'd... Yes, I will hold.\n",
      "The worst part about the Internet, when a secret is out, everyone knows. The best part about the Internet, that video of the dancing Indian midget, crossbow.org, massively multiplayer online gaming, i.e. Everquest. I also enjoy online banking.\n",
      "Okay. So I went on the Internet, and she is not gonna find another apartment for that price. I mean this one is twice as much, and it doesn't have parking. Does she like to park?\n",
      "Oh, loves it.\n",
      "Okay. This one is the same price but it's got...\n",
      "Green walls.\n",
      "I think that's mold.\n",
      "Ooh... fancy.\n",
      "Spiderman, Peter Parker, would not reveal his love for Mary Jane for fear that she might be captured and harmed by the Green Goblin. Now, if Michael had studied the Spidey principles that I'd drawn up for him, Jan's boobs might not be all over the Internet. [Dwight pretends to shoot out webs from his palms]\n",
      "Attention everyone! May I have your attention, please? Listen up. If we all work really hard and focus, we should be out of here in seven hours. Now, somewhere in these stacks, I have hidden a deck of cards. That should motivate you to keep your eyes open. If you find the deck of cards, you can redeem it with me in exchange for a free soft drink. [Jim shuffles the deck of cards] Get back... Back to work!\n",
      "Yes, it is The Island Luau Inventory '07. It's actually a success compared to Disco Audit '05.\n",
      "[Kelly singing] Hey! Hey! Stop your mouth, please.\n",
      "Please, I can double your pace.\n",
      "Let's go.\n",
      "[Dwight and Andy stacking boxes rapidly] Nice.\n",
      "Jim, move!\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Okay.\n",
      "Two at a time!\n",
      "Hey, Stanley, in case I don't see you again after tonight, here is your bonus, $1,000 cash. Keep the change. [hands Stanley a piece of Jamaican currency]\n",
      "It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.\n",
      "Yes, good luck with that.\n",
      "You're a box short on the black, medium-line ballpoints.\n",
      "Jim, could you come in here please?\n",
      "Hello.\n",
      "Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.\n",
      "Yeah, you can.\n",
      "You know what? Get Pam.\n",
      "For this?\n",
      "Pam.\n",
      "Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.\n",
      "Great.\n",
      "Oh, that is gross.\n",
      "Who is 'Long Tim'?\n",
      "Damn it.\n",
      "Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?\n",
      "I would love to meet Long Tim.\n",
      "Yeah. Right?\n",
      "Yeah.\n",
      "Ok.\n",
      "Ok. Bye Harvey.\n",
      "Everything is fine. You are in the clear.\n",
      "Dwight, care to join us, finally? Thank you.\n",
      "Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.\n",
      "Oh.\n",
      "Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.\n",
      "Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.\n",
      "Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.\n",
      "You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.\n",
      "So that just leaves Dwight and Jim.\n",
      "Ok, wait. Does anyone want to trade?\n",
      "Yup. I'll trade.\n",
      "Dwight and I used to go on sales calls all the time. In fact, I have a picture to remember that time. Oh young Jim. There is just so much I need to warn you about. And yet, tragically, I cannot.\n",
      "Dwight?\n",
      "Yup?\n",
      "Here ya go. [throws laundry]\n",
      "Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?\n",
      "Please.\n",
      "Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the 'Amazing Race.' [To Ryan and Stanley] And you guys are the retired marines. [To Phyllis and Karen] And you guys are the mother and daughter. [To Dwight and Jim] And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?\n",
      "No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.\n",
      "Just bragging rights.\n",
      "It's just... brrrrrr... It's 'Amazing Race,' Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.\n",
      "Come on!!\n",
      "Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!\n",
      "Seriously? You're going to sit in the back?\n",
      "Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.\n",
      "Here we go.\n",
      "Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.\n",
      "Really?\n",
      "Ok. Sure.\n",
      "Leave the keys.\n",
      "You still do that thing?\n",
      "Leave the keys!\n",
      "Hawkman.\n",
      "[Walks out of the Ladies' Restroom] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.\n",
      "After you sir.\n",
      "No thank you, I never let anyone walk behind me. Seven out of ten attacks are from the rear.\n",
      "Ok, well, that still leaves a 30% chance that I will attack you from the front.\n",
      "Uh, yeah, but it will be easier to stop. I can always block the blow. I can counter it with... [Jim slaps Dwight]\n",
      "Angela, you seem so happy. I bet you wish you were like this all the time.\n",
      "That's great.\n",
      "Hey, did you catch that up at Lake Wallenpaupack?\n",
      "You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.\n",
      "You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.\n",
      "I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "Stop it. [Puts his hand on Andy's shoulder] Stop it.\n",
      "Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. [excited] This is Pam. I did?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Ah, no. Don't worry about it.\n",
      "What?\n",
      "I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.\n",
      "We can offer our biggest discounts on 30% recycled and ultra-premium laser.\n",
      "Can I use your phone?\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Let me talk to you about a few of the other things we can offer. Namely, we know the tax season is coming up, so by April 1st we can have you fully stocked.\n",
      "[On Phone] One...\n",
